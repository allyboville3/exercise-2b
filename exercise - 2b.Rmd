# Lecture Notes

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
2 + 2
```

## Reproducible Research

Follow the principle of literate programming - document the *logic* behind the **analysis** and the **code**!

## Coding Options for Code Chunks to Adjust Output in HTML

1 - eval: evaluate the code chunk (if false, just echos the code in the output)   
2 - echo: include the source code in output   
3 - output: Include the results of executing the code in the output (true, false,or asis to indicate that the output is raw markdown and should not have any of Quartoâ€™s standard enclosing markdown)   
4 - warning: include warnings in output   
5 - error: include errors in the output (not that this implies that errors executing code will not halt the processing of the document)   

## Basic Math Coding

### This Code adds three and five together

```{r, output = TRUE}

3 + 5

```
